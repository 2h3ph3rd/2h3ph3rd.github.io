# AI vs ML vs DL

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 

These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning, and it is based on the structure and function of the brain.

This type of learning is known as deep learning because it involves a neural network with many layers between the input and output.

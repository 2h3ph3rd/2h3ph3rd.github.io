# Introduction

System: a physical mechanims that transforms inputs into outputs.

Model: a mathematical description of a system.

### Modeling approaches

- White box modeling: based on physical laws or prior knowledge.
- Black box modeling: based on experimental data.
- Gray box modeling: the equations are given, but some parameters are unknown.

### Type of systems

- Static systems: when the input variables are enough to determine the output.
- Dynamic systems: when the past behavior of the output influences the output itself.

The goal is to study black-box modeling of dynamic systems.

## Task 1 - Introduction

> Let's get started!

No answer needed

## Task 2 - The OSI Model: An Overview

> Which layer would choose to send data over TCP or UDP?

4

> Which layer checks received information to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted?

2

> In which layer would data be formatted in preparation for transmission?

2

> Which layer transmits and receives data?

1

> Which layer encrypts, compresses, or otherwise transforms the initial data to give it a standardised format?

6

> Which layer tracks communications between the host and receiving computers?

5

> Which layer accepts communication requests from applications?

7

> Which layer handles logical addressing?

3

> When sending data over TCP, what would you call the "bite-sized" pieces of data?

Segments

> [Research] Which layer would the FTP protocol communicate with?

7

> Which transport layer protocol would be best suited to transmit a live video?

UDP

## Task 3 - Encapsulation

> How would you refer to data at layer 2 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model)?

Frames

> How would you refer to data at layer 4 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model), if the UDP protocol has been selected?

Datagrams

> What process would a computer perform on a received message?

De-encapsulation

> Which is the only layer of the OSI model to add a trailer during encapsulation?

Data Link

> Does encapsulation provide an extra layer of security (Aye/Nay)?

Aye

## Task 4 - The TCP/IP Model

> Which model was introduced first, OSI or TCP/IP?

TCP/IP

> Which layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of the Transport layer of the OSI model (Full Name)?

Transport

> Which layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of the Session layer of the OSI model (Full Name)?

Application

> The Network Interface layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of two layers in the OSI model. These layers are Data Link, and?.. (Full Name)?

Physical

> Which layer of the TCP/IP model handles the functionality of the OSI network layer?

Internet

> What kind of protocol is TCP?

Connection-based

> What is SYN short for?

Synchronise

> What is the second step of the three way handshake?

SYN/ACK

> What is the short name for the "Acknowledgement" segment in the three-way handshake?

ACK

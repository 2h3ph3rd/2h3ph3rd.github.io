## Get those flags!

### Analyzing the code

The code provided in the room executes a simple encryption algorithm.

A first flag is read from an external file and then encrypted using a key.
The operation is performed by XORing between the flag and the key, repeating the key if it is shorter than the flag.

The encoded flag is then printed in hexadecimal format. This means that each byte of the flag is represented by two hexadecimal characters.

The machine then asks for the key and, if it is correct, returns a second flag.

### Exploiting the encryption

The key is 5 characters long, as can be seen in the code due to the k=5 parameter.

The flag on the other hand is 40 characters long, because the encoded flag is 80 hexadecimal characters long.

The first four characters of the plaintext are known as 'THM\{'.
These can be used to retrieve the first four characters of the key by XORing the plaintext with the known characters.

Since the length of the key is a perfect divisor of the length of the flag, the last character of the key is also known as the last character of the flag '\}'.

### The final script

The following script can be used to retrieve the key and the final flag:
